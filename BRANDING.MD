## Knative Branding Guidelines


The Knative logo is made available here with the following guidelines:

 **You may:**
 - use the logo for non-commercial uses such as t-shirts and stickers.
 - use the logo to link to knative.dev
 - use the logo in a blog post or news article about Knative
 - use the logo to advertise that your product has support for Knative [Note that at this time such usage does *not* indicate conformance with any standards or requirements]

**You may not:**

 - Use the Knative logo as your application's icon or logo
 - Create a modified version of the Knative logo (except for non-commercial uses such as t-shirts and stickers)
 - Integrate the Knative logo into your logo
 - Change the Knative logo's colors
 - Use the Knative logo in such a manner as to create the impression that your product or service has been certified, vetted, or otherwise endorsed by the Knative project. 


If the above guidelines do not cover your potential use case, or you're just not sure; please file an issue for the Steering Committee to review. Generally, Steering is likely to approve respectful variations of the Knative logo for non-commercial physical items ("swag"), but would like to review the usage first. 


The Knative Steering Committee understands the community desire for a conformance standard, and we do plan to implement one at a future date. We also recognize that conformance is a complicated issue with many variables, and it is still early days for the Knative project. For comparison, the Kubernetes project did not implement the [Certified Kubernetes Conformance Program](https://github.com/cncf/k8s-conformance) until version 1.7. Our goal is to have a Conformance Working Group created and convened by the end of 2020.
